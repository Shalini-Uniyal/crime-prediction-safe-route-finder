# 🌐 Crime Prediction & Safe Route Finder

**Crime Prediction & Safe Route Finder** is a smart system designed to enhance safety in urban areas using machine learning and geospatial analysis. This project predicts the likelihood of crimes in different parts of a city and helps users find the safest possible routes for travel.

## 🚀 Overview
In modern cities, safety is a major concern. Random crime occurrences make navigation risky, especially at night or in unfamiliar areas.  
This project addresses these issues by:

- Predicting high-risk areas based on historical crime data.
- Suggesting safe routes between locations using crime risk analysis.
- Assisting city authorities and residents in making informed decisions.
